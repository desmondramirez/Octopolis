## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
gene_master <- read.csv("/Users/crisniell/Desktop/GeneIDs - GGene Temp Master.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #temp master

cluster.markers <- read.csv("/Users/crisniell/Desktop/Allclustermarkers_hifiasm5cells_std082621.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #temp master

cluster.markers %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    top_n(n = 10, wt = diff_exp) ->top10

```


```{r}
# function to add gene names to data table
# assumes first column of table is G gene
# uses master list with gene name in 1st column, G gene in 3rd column
addGeneNamesTable<- function(data,gene_master){
  data$GeneName <- '' # create empty column 
  for (i in 1:nrow(data)){
    ggene = data[[i,1]]
    loc <- which(gene_master[[3]] ==ggene)
    if (length(loc)>0) {  # if something is found
      data$GeneName[[i]] <- gene_master[[loc[1],1]] # if multiple found, use 1st one
    }
  }
  
  data
}
```

```{r}
top10<-addGeneNamesTable(top10,gene_master)
top10
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
