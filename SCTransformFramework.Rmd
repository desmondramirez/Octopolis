## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Code Summary (Source: https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/integration.html)
1. create list of Seurat objects to integrate
2. perform SCTransform normalization separately for each dataset
3. run the PrepSCTIntregration function on the object list
4. Integrate datasets, and proceed with joint analysis

## Load in libraries and data
```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)
options(future.globals.maxSize = 4000 * 1024^2)
pancreas.data <- readRDS(file = "../data/pancreas_expression_matrix.rds")
metadata <- readRDS(file = "../data/pancreas_metadata.rds")
pancreas <- CreateSeuratObject(pancreas.data, meta.data = metadata)
pancreas.list <- SplitObject(pancreas, split.by = "tech")

for (i in 1:length(pancreas.list)) {
    pancreas.list[[i]] <- SCTransform(pancreas.list[[i]], verbose = FALSE)
}
```

## Select features for downstream integration, and run PrepSCTIntegration so that all necessary Pearson residuals have been calculated
```{r}
pancreas.features <- SelectIntegrationFeatures(object.list = pancreas.list, nfeatures = 3000)
pancreas.list <- PrepSCTIntegration(object.list = pancreas.list, anchor.features = pancreas.features, 
    verbose = FALSE)
```

## Identify anchors and integrate datasets. Use the standard workflow, with the exception that normalization.method = 'SCT'
```{r}
pancreas.anchors <- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = pancreas.list, normalization.method = "SCT", 
    anchor.features = pancreas.features, verbose = FALSE)
pancreas.integrated <- IntegrateData(anchorset = pancreas.anchors, normalization.method = "SCT", 
    verbose = FALSE)
```

## Next, we'll want to proceed with standard downstream analysis (i.e. visualization, clustering) except we will not run the ScaleData function. 
Note: You can see that after integration, cells group by their biological cell type (which has been pre-annotated), instead of by their underlying technology.
```{r}
pancreas.integrated <- RunPCA(pancreas.integrated, verbose = FALSE)
pancreas.integrated <- RunUMAP(pancreas.integrated, dims = 1:30)
plots <- DimPlot(pancreas.integrated, group.by = c("tech", "celltype"), combine = FALSE)
plots <- lapply(X = plots, FUN = function(x) x + theme(legend.position = "top") + guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3, 
    byrow = TRUE, override.aes = list(size = 3))))
CombinePlots(plots)
```

## Example: apply workflow to a series of human PBMC datasets from eight different technologies
```{r}
pbmc.data <- readRDS("../data/pbmc_ssc_mat.rds")
pbmc.metadata <- readRDS("../data/pbmc_ssc_metadata.rds")
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, meta.data = pbmc.metadata)

pbmc <- subset(pbmc, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200)
pbmc.list <- SplitObject(pbmc, split.by = "Method")
for (i in names(pbmc.list)) {
    pbmc.list[[i]] <- SCTransform(pbmc.list[[i]], verbose = FALSE)
}
pbmc.features <- SelectIntegrationFeatures(object.list = pbmc.list, nfeatures = 3000)
pbmc.list <- PrepSCTIntegration(object.list = pbmc.list, anchor.features = pbmc.features)
pbmc.anchors <- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = pbmc.list, normalization.method = "SCT", 
    anchor.features = pbmc.features)
pbmc.integrated <- IntegrateData(anchorset = pbmc.anchors, normalization.method = "SCT")

pbmc.integrated <- RunPCA(object = pbmc.integrated, verbose = FALSE)
pbmc.integrated <- RunUMAP(object = pbmc.integrated, dims = 1:30)

plots <- DimPlot(pbmc.integrated, group.by = c("Method", "CellType"), combine = FALSE)
plots <- lapply(X = plots, FUN = function(x) x + theme(legend.position = "top") + guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3, 
    byrow = TRUE, override.aes = list(size = 3))))
CombinePlots(plots)

# Cells are grouped together by shared biological subtype instead of technology
DimPlot(pbmc.integrated, group.by = "CellType", split.by = "Method", ncol = 3)

# Integrated analysis is able to reveal finer subdivisions among broad cell types since the combined dataset has substantially greater statistical power. Note: you can add "split.by = 'Method'" to make these plots for each technology independently.
DefaultAssay(pbmc.integrated) <- "RNA"

# Normalize RNA data for visualization purposes
pbmc.integrated <- NormalizeData(pbmc.integrated, verbose = FALSE)
FeaturePlot(pbmc.integrated, c("CCR7", "S100A4", "GZMB", "GZMK", "GZMH", "TCL1A"))
```
